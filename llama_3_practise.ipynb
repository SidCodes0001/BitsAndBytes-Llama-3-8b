              "'machine learning is   a broad term that encompasses many different techniques,   including those that have been around for decades, such as   the nearest-neighbor algorithm.   The field of machine learning   has a rich history, starting in 1959 with Arthur Samuel\\'s   definition of machine learning as \"the ability to learn from   experience.\"   In 1967, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published a book   titled \"Perceptrons,\" which helped to popularize the idea   of neural networks.   The field of machine learning   has made tremendous progress in recent years, with   many new algorithms and techniques being developed.
